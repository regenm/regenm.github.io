advice, here are 40 things that I would say.<br>Make sure you are climbing the right mountain<br>0:10<br>Number one, make sure you are climbing the right mountain.<br>0:14<br>Too many of us are exhausted<br>0:17<br>because we are doing too little of the things that bring us joy<br>0:20<br>and are chasing someone else’s definition of success.<br>0:23<br>This is why it is far better to be climbing slowly<br>0:26<br>up the right mountain than it is to be climbing fast up the wrong mountain.<br>0:30<br>When you focus on direction over speed,<br>0:33<br>you will find greater enjoyment in the journey.<br>Stop making your health a side hustle<br>0:36<br>Number two.<br>0:37<br>Stop making your health a side hustle.<br>0:39<br>moment that you sacrifice your health<br>0:42<br>is the moment that your overall well-being begins to deteriorate.<br>0:45<br>Your health is the most valuable asset you have.<br>0:49<br>Without it, nothing else matters.<br>0:51<br>Life is hard enough as it is.<br>0:54<br>Don’t make it harder by not looking after yourself.<br>0:56<br>Energy, you see, is earned and not given.<br>1:00<br>And it is earned by sleeping more,<br>1:03<br>eating better and exercising on a daily basis.<br>1:06<br>So work with your body, not against it.<br>1:09<br>If not, you will eventually be faced with no choice<br>1:13<br>but to spend a lot of time dealing with illness later in life.<br>Designing your life begins with designing your days<br>1:16<br>Number three, how you spend your days is how you spend your life.<br>1:21<br>If you are not prioritizing the daily actions necessary to achieve<br>1:25<br>your goals, you will never arrive at where you would like to be.<br>1:29<br>I mean, how can tomorrow be any better than today<br>1:32<br>if you don’t do anything different today.<br>1:34<br>You will never change your life for the better<br>1:37<br>unless you change something you do daily.<br>1:40<br>So care less<br>1:41<br>about results and more about your daily habits.<br>1:45<br>Because world class results automatically follow world class habits.<br>1:51<br>And this leads me on to Number four,<br>Take responsibility for your life<br>1:53<br>take responsibility for your life.<br>1:56<br>No one is coming to save you.<br>1:59<br>And this is why you must step up and become the hero of your own life.<br>2:03<br>Taking full ownership of your life is the most empowering thing<br>2:07<br>that you can do Because the pain of doing nothing with your life<br>2:11<br>will always be worse than the pain of doing something with your life.<br>2:15<br>Most people, unfortunately, are allergic to personal responsibility,<br>2:19<br>preferring instead to complain and blame.<br>2:23<br>Don’t be most people.<br>Have a bias to action<br>2:24<br>Number five have a bias to action.<br>2:27<br>The only real failure in life<br>2:30<br>is never trying or taking action on the things that matter most to you.<br>2:35<br>The average human life is short (right now globally,<br>2:38<br>it is at 73 years) and so you only have one shot at this.<br>2:43<br>We all know deep down that life is short<br>2:47<br>and we will face death eventually.<br>2:49<br>But few of us appreciate this.<br>2:52<br>If we did, we would make very different decisions.<br>2:56<br>Losing my mom at just 17 years old taught me the fragility of life.<br>3:01<br>The future is never guaranteed, and the loss<br>3:04<br>taught me the importance of living in the present.<br>3:07<br>Time is something we can’t make more of.<br>3:10<br>So we must be careful about what we decide to give up a day of our life for.<br>3:15<br>Because once it is gone, it is gone forever.<br>3:18<br>And this leads nicely onto number six.<br>Extraordinary results come from repeating ordinary actions over an unordinary amount of time<br>3:21<br>Extraordinary results come from repeating<br>3:24<br>ordinary actions over an unordinary amount of time.<br>3:28<br>Much of success in life, you see, is built by consistently doing the work<br>3:32<br>that most are not willing to do.<br>3:34<br>And if you can’t do something consistently over a long period of time,<br>3:39<br>you probably won’t succeed at it.<br>3:40<br>There is no such thing as an overnight success,<br>3:44<br>only over time success.<br>3:46<br>So be patient with the process and impatient with taking action.<br>Choose your life partner wisely<br>3:50<br>Number seven, choose your life partner wisely.<br>3:53<br>Ryan Holiday wrote an article in 2015 called “The Perfect Spouse is the Best<br>3:59<br>Life Hack No One Told You About.” And I would have to agree with his thoughts<br>4:03<br>because without having my wife, Laurie by my side,<br>4:06<br>I would not be enjoying many of the things that I get to experience today.<br>4:09<br>We have been together for nearly two decades.<br>4:12<br>My success is our success.<br>4:14<br>Her success is our success.<br>4:18<br>And when faced with challenges and setbacks,<br>4:21<br>we look to overcome and learn from them as a team.<br>4:23<br>When choosing a life partner, therefore, be with someone who shares the same values<br>4:28<br>as you and who is also focused on being better than who they were yesterday.<br>The hardest times in life equip you with the wisdom to create the best moments of your life<br>4:33<br>Number eight, the hardest times in life equip<br>4:36<br>you with the wisdom to create the best moments of your life.<br>4:39<br>Just because your past was hard does not mean your future cannot be amazing.<br>4:44<br>It is from life’s inevitable challenges that you enjoy<br>4:47<br>your greatest personal growth, and discover more about who you truly are.<br>4:52<br>And the tougher the times, the more clarity you get<br>4:57<br>about what really matters and what doesn’t.<br>Public speaking is one of the most powerful skills you can develop<br>5:00<br>Number nine,<br>5:00<br>public speaking is one of the most powerful skills that you can develop.<br>5:04<br>Your ability to touch people’s hearts and minds by educating<br>5:09<br>and inspiring them will open you up to a world of opportunities.<br>5:13<br>So develop your storytelling skills and watch your career blossom.<br>Speak to yourself in the same way you would to someone you deeply care about<br>5:17<br>Number ten.<br>5:18<br>Speak to yourself in the same way you would to someone you deeply care about.<br>5:23<br>This is because the most powerful dialogue that happens<br>5:27<br>is the one within yourself each day.<br>5:30<br>Your mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy.<br>One of the best ways to advance your life is to simplify it<br>5:33<br>Number 11.<br>5:34<br>One of the best ways to advance your life is to simplify it Less clutter -<br>5:40<br>physical, mental and digital - paves the way<br>5:43<br>for clearer thinking and more focused action<br>5:47<br>because nobody performs well when pulled in a dozen different directions.<br>Be fully present when spending quality time with people, especially your loved ones<br>5:51<br>Number 12 be fully present when spending quality time with people,<br>5:56<br>especially your loved ones.<br>5:57<br>One of the greatest gifts that you can give people<br>6:01<br>is the feeling that they’ve been heard, understood, and appreciated.<br>6:05<br>This is because people do not want your time<br>6:08<br>as much as they want your presence and energy.<br>6:11<br>So wherever you are, be there.<br>6:14<br>Whether that is having dinner with a friend, playing<br>6:17<br>with your children, or spending quality time with your partner.<br>The only competition that matters in life is with yourself<br>6:20<br>Number 13.<br>6:22<br>The only competition that matters in life is with yourself.<br>6:26<br>Yesterday’s you, last month’s you, last year’s you.<br>6:27<br>Focus<br>6:31<br>on outdoing your past self and you will flourish.<br>6:34<br>And if you are going to look at others,<br>6:36<br>look at them for inspiration, not comparison.<br>Not everyone will like you<br>6:40<br>Number 14.<br>6:41<br>Not everyone will like you.<br>6:43<br>And that’s okay When you put yourself out there, you will always have some people<br>6:48<br>that will hate<br>6:50<br>you whatever you do.<br>6:50<br>That’s okay. You’re not ice cream.<br>6:53<br>You can’t please everyone.<br>6:55<br>You can’t escape being judged.<br>6:57<br>So you might as well live a life true to yourself.<br>7:00<br>Not a life lived for others. Number 15.<br>Get clear on your priorities and productivity becomes easy<br>7:03<br>Get clear on your priorities and productivity becomes easy.<br>7:07<br>How will you know that today will have been a productive day?<br>7:11<br>Begin with the end in mind, work backwards and move forwards with purpose.<br>Be bold and take some risks<br>7:16<br>Number 16. Be bold and take some risks.<br>7:19<br>Not all risk takers will be winners, but all winners are risk takers.<br>7:24<br>If you want to enjoy a life the most can’t, you must do what most won’t.<br>7:29<br>So be bold and start stretching yourself out of your comfort zones.<br>7:33<br>Put that ask out there.<br>7:35<br>Start on the idea that you’ve been thinking about for so long.<br>7:39<br>Go to that event.<br>7:40<br>Say yes to that opportunity.<br>7:43<br>Do this every day and your life will flourish.<br>You get what you focus your energy on<br>7:46<br>Number 17.<br>7:47<br>You get what you focus your energy on.<br>7:49<br>Focus on things to complain about, and you will attract more things<br>7:53<br>into your life to complain about.<br>7:55<br>Focus on things to be grateful for and you will attract more things<br>7:59<br>into your life to be grateful for.<br>Be prepared for the best laid plans to not go the way you expect<br>8:00<br>Number 18 Be prepared for<br>8:03<br>the best laid plans to not go the way you expect.<br>8:07<br>I wanted to develop a successful career in finance after graduating from university<br>8:12<br>and then the financial crisis happened, which was actually a blessing in disguise.<br>8:16<br>Otherwise, I wouldn’t be sitting here right now talking to you.<br>8:19<br>And my friend opened a new restaurant four months before the COVID pandemic<br>8:23<br>Shut everything down.<br>8:24<br>Sometimes life doesn’t go according to plan,<br>8:28<br>and it ends up being the best thing that has ever happened to you.<br>8:32<br>The harsh reality is that when you commit to doing something with your life,<br>8:37<br>you will face inevitable setbacks and failures.<br>8:40<br>However how you respond to them will be the difference<br>8:43<br>between giving up too early and bouncing back stronger<br>8:47<br>from the wisdom that you have gained from that experience.<br>8:51<br>Which leads me nicely onto Number 19.<br>Don’t fear failure, fear regret<br>8:54<br>Don’t fear failure, fear regret.<br>8:57<br>More often than not,<br>8:58<br>success is born out of a series of setbacks, wrong turns and failures.<br>9:03<br>So when you avoid taking action because you are afraid of failure,<br>9:08<br>you actually hurt your chances for success.<br>9:10<br>There is a beautiful Japanese saying that goes: if you feel like<br>9:14<br>you are losing everything, remember this: trees lose their leaves every year.<br>9:21<br>Yet they still stand tall, waiting for better days to come.<br>The purpose of life is a life of purpose<br>9:25<br>Number 20.<br>9:26<br>The purpose of life is a life of purpose.<br>9:29<br>You were not born into this world to just pay bills, scroll aimlessly through<br>9:34<br>social media feeds, watch television, do things you hate, and then die.<br>9:39<br>You were born with unique gifts and talents, and it is life’s greatest<br>9:44<br>adventure to discover what these are and to share them with the world.<br>9:48<br>Don’t go through life accepting that five out of seven days<br>9:53<br>are going to be spent doing something that does not bring

to,<br>10:52<br>just to please other people and activities that would take you away from<br>10:56<br>the very things that will help you make progress towards where you want to be.<br>Do the work<br>11:00<br>Number 24.<br>11:02<br>If you did the work that you are currently avoiding,<br>11:05<br>you would have the results that you want At a minimum,<br>11:08<br>you will always end up in a

architect of your destiny.<br>13:32<br>You are both the sculpture and the sculptor<br>13:34<br>with your thoughts shaping your entire reality.<br>13:38<br>Your thoughts, therefore, can either be the

small, and watch your life transform.<br>Unknown paths often lead to the most rewarding journeys<br>14:01<br>Number 32.<br>14:02<br>Unknown paths often lead to the most rewarding journeys.<br>14:06<br>When you surrender to the unknown, you allow yourself to explore and experiment.<br>14:11<br>So be open to new experiences, constantly meet new people, try stuff<br>14:17<br>just because it is interesting and fun, and do a few things<br>14:21<br>that you will be excited to tell your kids about someday.<br>Spending money on things you don’t need to impress others is the fastest

invest and then put that money to work for you<br>14:37<br>so you can grow your financial wealth over time.<br>14:39<br>This way you are able to tap into the power of the compound effect.<br>14:44<br>The eighth wonder of this world.<br>14:46<br>Just look at Warren Buffett,<br>14:47<br>one of the most successful investors the world has seen.<br>14:51<br>99% of his current wealth

wellbeing to an outcome that may or may not happen<br>15:19<br>Don’t tie your emotional well-being to something in the future<br>15:23<br>that may or may not happen.<br>15:24<br>Doing so will mean that you will end up living as if you are never going to die<br>15:29<br>and then die having never truly lived.<br>15:31<br>And your present will be full of anxiety, frustration and stress.<br>15:36<br>Inner peace comes from accepting what you can’t control<br>15:39<br>and focusing your energy instead on what you can.<br>Listen to your heart<br>15:42<br>Number 37.
