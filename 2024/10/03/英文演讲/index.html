<p>Today is my 40th birthday.<br>0:02<br>And if I could go back to talk to my younger 20 year old self<br>0:06<br>and give him some advice, here are 40 things that I would say.<br>Make sure you are climbing the right mountain<br>0:10<br>Number one, make sure you are climbing the right mountain.<br>0:14<br>Too many of us are exhausted<br>0:17<br>because we are doing too little of the things that bring us joy<br>0:20<br>and are chasing someone else’s definition of success.<br>0:23<br>This is why it is far better to be climbing slowly<br>0:26<br>up the right mountain than it is to be climbing fast up the wrong mountain.<br>0:30<br>When you focus on direction over speed,<br>0:33<br>you will find greater enjoyment in the journey.<br>Stop making your health a side hustle<br>0:36<br>Number two.<br>0:37<br>Stop making your health a side hustle.<br>0:39<br>moment that you sacrifice your health<br>0:42<br>is the moment that your overall well-being begins to deteriorate.<br>0:45<br>Your health is the most valuable asset you have.<br>0:49<br>Without it, nothing else matters.<br>0:51<br>Life is hard enough as it is.<br>0:54<br>Don’t make it harder by not looking after yourself.<br>0:56<br>Energy, you see, is earned and not given.<br>1:00<br>And it is earned by sleeping more,<br>1:03<br>eating better and exercising on a daily basis.<br>1:06<br>So work with your body, not against it.<br>1:09<br>If not, you will eventually be faced with no choice<br>1:13<br>but to spend a lot of time dealing with illness later in life.<br>Designing your life begins with designing your days<br>1:16<br>Number three, how you spend your days is how you spend your life.<br>1:21<br>If you are not prioritizing the daily actions necessary to achieve<br>1:25<br>your goals, you will never arrive at where you would like to be.<br>1:29<br>I mean, how can tomorrow be any better than today<br>1:32<br>if you don’t do anything different today.<br>1:34<br>You will never change your life for the better<br>1:37<br>unless you change something you do daily.<br>1:40<br>So care less<br>1:41<br>about results and more about your daily habits.<br>1:45<br>Because world class results automatically follow world class habits.<br>1:51<br>And this leads me on to Number four,<br>Take responsibility for your life<br>1:53<br>take responsibility for your life.<br>1:56<br>No one is coming to save you.<br>1:59<br>And this is why you must step up and become the hero of your own life.<br>2:03<br>Taking full ownership of your life is the most empowering thing<br>2:07<br>that you can do Because the pain of doing nothing with your life<br>2:11<br>will always be worse than the pain of doing something with your life.<br>2:15<br>Most people, unfortunately, are allergic to personal responsibility,<br>2:19<br>preferring instead to complain and blame.<br>2:23<br>Don’t be most people.<br>Have a bias to action<br>2:24<br>Number five have a bias to action.<br>2:27<br>The only real failure in life<br>2:30<br>is never trying or taking action on the things that matter most to you.<br>2:35<br>The average human life is short (right now globally,<br>2:38<br>it is at 73 years) and so you only have one shot at this.<br>2:43<br>We all know deep down that life is short<br>2:47<br>and we will face death eventually.<br>2:49<br>But few of us appreciate this.<br>2:52<br>If we did, we would make very different decisions.<br>2:56<br>Losing my mom at just 17 years old taught me the fragility of life.<br>3:01<br>The future is never guaranteed, and the loss<br>3:04<br>taught me the importance of living in the present.<br>3:07<br>Time is something we can’t make more of.<br>3:10<br>So we must be careful about what we decide to give up a day of our life for.<br>3:15<br>Because once it is gone, it is gone forever.<br>3:18<br>And this leads nicely onto number six.<br>Extraordinary results come from repeating ordinary actions over an unordinary amount of time<br>3:21<br>Extraordinary results come from repeating<br>3:24<br>ordinary actions over an unordinary amount of time.<br>3:28<br>Much of success in life, you see, is built by consistently doing the work<br>3:32<br>that most are not willing to do.<br>3:34<br>And if you can’t do something consistently over a long period of time,<br>3:39<br>you probably won’t succeed at it.<br>3:40<br>There is no such thing as an overnight success,<br>3:44<br>only over time success.<br>3:46<br>So be patient with the process and impatient with taking action.<br>Choose your life partner wisely<br>3:50<br>Number seven, choose your life partner wisely.<br>3:53<br>Ryan Holiday wrote an article in 2015 called “The Perfect Spouse is the Best<br>3:59<br>Life Hack No One Told You About.” And I would have to agree with his thoughts<br>4:03<br>because without having my wife, Laurie by my side,<br>4:06<br>I would not be enjoying many of the things that I get to experience today.<br>4:09<br>We have been together for nearly two decades.<br>4:12<br>My success is our success.<br>4:14<br>Her success is our success.<br>4:18<br>And when faced with challenges and setbacks,<br>4:21<br>we look to overcome and learn from them as a team.<br>4:23<br>When choosing a life partner, therefore, be with someone who shares the same values<br>4:28<br>as you and who is also focused on being better than who they were yesterday.<br>The hardest times in life equip you with the wisdom to create the best moments of your life<br>4:33<br>Number eight, the hardest times in life equip<br>4:36<br>you with the wisdom to create the best moments of your life.<br>4:39<br>Just because your past was hard does not mean your future cannot be amazing.<br>4:44<br>It is from life’s inevitable challenges that you enjoy<br>4:47<br>your greatest personal growth, and discover more about who you truly are.<br>4:52<br>And the tougher the times, the more clarity you get<br>4:57<br>about what really matters and what doesn’t.<br>Public speaking is one of the most powerful skills you can develop<br>5:00<br>Number nine,<br>5:00<br>public speaking is one of the most powerful skills that you can develop.<br>5:04<br>Your ability to touch people’s hearts and minds by educating<br>5:09<br>and inspiring them will open you up to a world of opportunities.<br>5:13<br>So develop your storytelling skills and watch your career blossom.<br>Speak to yourself in the same way you would to someone you deeply care about<br>5:17<br>Number ten.<br>5:18<br>Speak to yourself in the same way you would to someone you deeply care about.<br>5:23<br>This is because the most powerful dialogue that happens<br>5:27<br>is the one within yourself each day.<br>5:30<br>Your mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy.<br>One of the best ways to advance your life is to simplify it<br>5:33<br>Number 11.<br>5:34<br>One of the best ways to advance your life is to simplify it Less clutter -<br>5:40<br>physical, mental and digital - paves the way<br>5:43<br>for clearer thinking and more focused action<br>5:47<br>because nobody performs well when pulled in a dozen different directions.<br>Be fully present when spending quality time with people, especially your loved ones<br>5:51<br>Number 12 be fully present when spending quality time with people,<br>5:56<br>especially your loved ones.<br>5:57<br>One of the greatest gifts that you can give people<br>6:01<br>is the feeling that they’ve been heard, understood, and appreciated.<br>6:05<br>This is because people do not want your time<br>6:08<br>as much as they want your presence and energy.<br>6:11<br>So wherever you are, be there.<br>6:14<br>Whether that is having dinner with a friend, playing<br>6:17<br>with your children, or spending quality time with your partner.<br>The only competition that matters in life is with yourself<br>6:20<br>Number 13.<br>6:22<br>The only competition that matters in life is with yourself.<br>6:26<br>Yesterday’s you, last month’s you, last year’s you.<br>6:27<br>Focus<br>6:31<br>on outdoing your past self and you will flourish.<br>6:34<br>And if you are going to look at others,<br>6:36<br>look at them for inspiration, not comparison.<br>Not everyone will like you<br>6:40<br>Number 14.<br>6:41<br>Not everyone will like you.<br>6:43<br>And that’s okay When you put yourself out there, you will always have some people<br>6:48<br>that will hate<br>6:50<br>you whatever you do.<br>6:50<br>That’s okay. You’re not ice cream.<br>6:53<br>You can’t please everyone.<br>6:55<br>You can’t escape being judged.<br>6:57<br>So you might as well live a life true to yourself.<br>7:00<br>Not a life lived for others. Number 15.<br>Get clear on your priorities and productivity becomes easy<br>7:03<br>Get clear on your priorities and productivity becomes easy.<br>7:07<br>How will you know that today will have been a productive day?<br>7:11<br>Begin with the end in mind, work backwards and move forwards with purpose.<br>Be bold and take some risks<br>7:16<br>Number 16. Be bold and take some risks.<br>7:19<br>Not all risk takers will be winners, but all winners are risk takers.<br>7:24<br>If you want to enjoy a life the most can’t, you must do what most won’t.<br>7:29<br>So be bold and start stretching yourself out of your comfort zones.<br>7:33<br>Put that ask out there.<br>7:35<br>Start on the idea that you’ve been thinking about for so long.<br>7:39<br>Go to that event.<br>7:40<br>Say yes to that opportunity.<br>7:43<br>Do this every day and your life will flourish.<br>You get what you focus your energy on<br>7:46<br>Number 17.<br>7:47<br>You get what you focus your energy on.<br>7:49<br>Focus on things to complain about, and you will attract more things<br>7:53<br>into your life to complain about.<br>7:55<br>Focus on things to be grateful for and you will attract more things<br>7:59<br>into your life to be grateful for.<br>Be prepared for the best laid plans to not go the way you expect<br>8:00<br>Number 18 Be prepared for<br>8:03<br>the best laid plans to not go the way you expect.<br>8:07<br>I wanted to develop a successful career in finance after graduating from university<br>8:12<br>and then the financial crisis happened, which was actually a blessing in disguise.<br>8:16<br>Otherwise, I wouldn’t be sitting here right now talking to you.<br>8:19<br>And my friend opened a new restaurant four months before the COVID pandemic<br>8:23<br>Shut everything down.<br>8:24<br>Sometimes life doesn’t go according to plan,<br>8:28<br>and it ends up being the best thing that has ever happened to you.<br>8:32<br>The harsh reality is that when you commit to doing something with your life,<br>8:37<br>you will face inevitable setbacks and failures.<br>8:40<br>However how you respond to them will be the difference<br>8:43<br>between giving up too early and bouncing back stronger<br>8:47<br>from the wisdom that you have gained from that experience.<br>8:51<br>Which leads me nicely onto Number 19.<br>Don’t fear failure, fear regret<br>8:54<br>Don’t fear failure, fear regret.<br>8:57<br>More often than not,<br>8:58<br>success is born out of a series of setbacks, wrong turns and failures.<br>9:03<br>So when you avoid taking action because you are afraid of failure,<br>9:08<br>you actually hurt your chances for success.<br>9:10<br>There is a beautiful Japanese saying that goes: if you feel like<br>9:14<br>you are losing everything, remember this: trees lose their leaves every year.<br>9:21<br>Yet they still stand tall, waiting for better days to come.<br>The purpose of life is a life of purpose<br>9:25<br>Number 20.<br>9:26<br>The purpose of life is a life of purpose.<br>9:29<br>You were not born into this world to just pay bills, scroll aimlessly through<br>9:34<br>social media feeds, watch television, do things you hate, and then die.<br>9:39<br>You were born with unique gifts and talents, and it is life’s greatest<br>9:44<br>adventure to discover what these are and to share them with the world.<br>9:48<br>Don’t go through life accepting that five out of seven days<br>9:53<br>are going to be spent doing something that does not bring you joy or fulfillment.<br>9:57<br>Live each day with intention so that you own your days<br>10:01<br>rather than your days owning you Number 21.<br>Knowing yourself is the beginning of true wisdom<br>10:04<br>Knowing yourself is the beginning of true wisdom.<br>10:08<br>This is because you can’t have self-development without self-awareness.<br>10:13<br>For you can’t change what you are not aware of.<br>10:16<br>Number 22.<br>10:17<br>On the days where it feels like you will never make progress.<br>10:20<br>Just remember how far you have come.<br>Remember how far you have come<br>10:23<br>If you can’t be grateful for what you currently have,<br>10:27<br>you will never have enough.<br>10:28<br>Appreciate where you are in your journey,<br>10:31<br>even if it is not where you want to be.<br>10:34<br>For every season serves a purpose.<br>Stop filling your calendar with junk<br>10:36<br>Number 23.<br>10:38<br>Stop filling your calendar with junk.<br>10:40<br>If you want your life to change, you must make space for it to happen.<br>10:45<br>Nothing more can be added to a full calendar, a calendar<br>10:48<br>that can often be filled with things that you have said yes to,<br>10:52<br>just to please other people and activities that would take you away from<br>10:56<br>the very things that will help you make progress towards where you want to be.<br>Do the work<br>11:00<br>Number 24.<br>11:02<br>If you did the work that you are currently avoiding,<br>11:05<br>you would have the results that you want At a minimum,<br>11:08<br>you will always end up in a better place by doing the work than avoiding it.<br>11:12<br>Overthinking, on the other hand, is the death of all great ideas and<br>11:16<br>opportunities.<br>11:17<br>You don’t have to have it all figured out in order to move forward.<br>11:20<br>The clarity you seek will come from the action that you take,<br>11:25<br>and the next piece of advice will help with this.<br>Get important tasks done early in the day<br>11:27<br>Number 25<br>11:29<br>get important tasks done early in the day when your energy is at its highest.<br>11:33<br>Once these are done, whatever else happens later in the day,<br>11:37<br>you will have already had a productive day.<br>Have patience with the journey ahead<br>11:39<br>Number 26.<br>11:41<br>Have patience with the journey ahead To become a success story,<br>11:45<br>you must be willing to look stupid<br>11:47<br>and like a beginner for a long time before you start getting things right.<br>11:50<br>Too many people ignore their dreams because they dislike<br>11:54<br>the idea of being a beginner and learning slowly.<br>11:57<br>So don’t let impatience and the fear of embarrassment<br>12:02<br>become the biggest hurdle to your growth.<br>12:04<br>Sometimes it takes ten years to get that one year<br>12:08<br>that will completely change your life.<br>Act from your future, not your past<br>12:10<br>Number 27 Act from your future, not your past.<br>12:14<br>Let’s fast forward to a year from now and imagine that your life is the best<br>12:18<br>that it has ever been as a result of your own intentional choices.<br>12:23<br>What choices did you make today and in the coming weeks and months<br>12:27<br>that made this reality a possibility for you?<br>Level up your network<br>12:31<br>Number 28.<br>12:32<br>Level up your network.<br>12:34<br>The fastest way to make meaningful progress<br>12:37<br>in any area of your life is to design an environment around you<br>12:41<br>that makes it impossible not to succeed Your circle of friends<br>12:45<br>will also change as you grow.<br>12:47<br>And this is all part of the personal development journey.<br>12:50<br>It is why your new life will cost you your old one.<br>12:53<br>It is part of your evolution<br>12:55<br>and becoming as you move into the next phase of your growth.<br>12:59<br>Not everyone is focused on being better than who they were yesterday,<br>13:03<br>and that’s okay.<br>Commit to learning on a daily basis<br>13:04<br>Number 29.<br>13:06<br>Commit to learning on a daily basis.<br>13:08<br>There is this 100 hour rule which states<br>13:11<br>that if you spend 100 hours a year deepening your knowledge<br>13:15<br>in your chosen discipline (which is around 18 minutes a day),<br>13:19<br>you will be better than 95% of the world in that discipline.<br>13:24<br>So what will you spend your 18 minutes today learning about?<br>You are the architect of your destiny<br>13:28<br>Number 30.<br>13:29<br>You are the architect of your destiny.<br>13:32<br>You are both the sculpture and the sculptor<br>13:34<br>with your thoughts shaping your entire reality.<br>13:38<br>Your thoughts, therefore, can either be the gateway<br>13:41<br>to limitless achievement or a prison cell for your potential.<br>Make a difference, not just a living<br>13:45<br>Number 31.<br>13:47<br>Focus on making a difference, not just a living.<br>13:50<br>Your value is determined by<br>13:52<br>how much more you have given to the world than you have taken from it.<br>13:56<br>Add value to people’s each day,<br>13:58<br>however small, and watch your life transform.<br>Unknown paths often lead to the most rewarding journeys<br>14:01<br>Number 32.<br>14:02<br>Unknown paths often lead to the most rewarding journeys.<br>14:06<br>When you surrender to the unknown, you allow yourself to explore and experiment.<br>14:11<br>So be open to new experiences, constantly meet new people, try stuff<br>14:17<br>just because it is interesting and fun, and do a few things<br>14:21<br>that you will be excited to tell your kids about someday.<br>Spending money on things you don’t need to impress others is the fastest way to go broke<br>14:23<br>Number 33.<br>14:25<br>Spending money on things you don’t need or want<br>14:29<br>just to impress others is the fastest way to go broke.<br>14:32<br>Instead, learn how to invest and then put that money to work for you<br>14:37<br>so you can grow your financial wealth over time.<br>14:39<br>This way you are able to tap into the power of the compound effect.<br>14:44<br>The eighth wonder of this world.<br>14:46<br>Just look at Warren Buffett,<br>14:47<br>one of the most successful investors the world has seen.<br>14:51<br>99% of his current wealth was created after his 50th birthday.<br>Do stuff that makes you feel alive<br>14:56<br>Number 34.<br>14:57<br>Do stuff that makes you feel alive.<br>15:00<br>Focus your energy on things that make you come alive<br>15:04<br>and away from the things that make you miserable.<br>15:07<br>This is key to fulfilling your potential.<br>You will have good seasons and bad seasons<br>15:09<br>Number 35.<br>15:10<br>You will have good seasons and bad seasons.<br>15:13<br>You can’t control the weather, only be prepared for it.<br>15:16<br>And this leads me to Number 36.<br>Don’t tie your emotional wellbeing to an outcome that may or may not happen<br>15:19<br>Don’t tie your emotional well-being to something in the future<br>15:23<br>that may or may not happen.<br>15:24<br>Doing so will mean that you will end up living as if you are never going to die<br>15:29<br>and then die having never truly lived.<br>15:31<br>And your present will be full of anxiety, frustration and stress.<br>15:36<br>Inner peace comes from accepting what you can’t control<br>15:39<br>and focusing your energy instead on what you can.<br>Listen to your heart<br>15:42<br>Number 37. Listen to your heart.<br>15:45<br>There is a reason why the longest journey you will make<br>15:49<br>are the inches from your head to your heart.<br>15:51<br>Too often we ignore our intuition and innate wisdom<br>15:55<br>and place too much importance on the opinions of others,<br>15:58<br>many of whom have not succeeded in what you are trying to do with your life.<br>16:03<br>In fact… Number 38.<br>Don’t take advice from those who haven’t done what you are trying to do<br>16:05<br>Don’t take advice from those who haven’t done what you are trying to do.<br>16:10<br>Everyone has advice to share with you.<br>16:13<br>Just make sure you are taking it from someone who has been in the arena<br>16:17<br>and not sitting on the sidelines as a spectator.<br>Leadership begins with you<br>16:20<br>Number 39.<br>16:21<br>Leadership begins with you.<br>16:24<br>You cannot be an effective leader of others<br>16:27<br>if you are not powerfully leading yourself first.<br>16:30<br>Lead yourself by living with intention each day.<br>16:33<br>And very soon your life will transform in the most magical of ways.<br>16:38<br>And this begins with taking care of your physical and mental energy,<br>16:42<br>for you can’t give what you don’t have.<br>16:44<br>And finally, number 40, It is never too late to make a change.<br>It is never too late to make a change<br>16:49<br>At some point you have to be honest<br>16:52<br>about the gap between the life you want to live,<br>16:55<br>and the life that your daily habits are currently leading you towards.<br>16:59<br>If your habits are causing that gap to widen, then do something about it.<br>17:03<br>It is never too late to make changes in your life to close that gap<br>17:08<br>between where you are now and where you want to be.<br>17:11<br>I hope you found this video useful.<br>17:13<br>Choose a few to implement this week<br>17:16<br>and see how simple adjustments to the way you operate can create dramatic change.<br>17:21<br>And make sure to keep this in mind.<br>17:23<br>You will suck at most things in the beginning With commitment,<br>17:27<br>consistency, persistence and patience,<br>17:30<br>however, anything becomes possible.<br>17:33<br>if you enjoyed this video,<br>17:35<br>it would be amazing<br>17:36<br>if you could subscribe, leave a comment below and give it a like.<br>17:40<br>Thank you for watching this far and I will see you in the next video.</p>

<p>615<br>00:46:35,878 –&gt; 00:46:40,089<br>I thought about what you said to me<br>the other day. About my painting.</p>
<p>616<br>00:46:40,215 –&gt; 00:46:41,413<br>Oh.</p>
<p>617<br>00:46:41,549 –&gt; 00:46:44,170<br>Stayed up half the night<br>thinkin’ about it.</p>
<p>618<br>00:46:45,511 –&gt; 00:46:47,717<br>Something occurred to me.</p>
<p>619<br>00:46:47,846 –&gt; 00:46:52,306<br>I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep<br>and haven’t thought about you since.</p>
<p>620<br>00:46:52,433 –&gt; 00:46:55,387</p>
<p>You know what occurred to me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>621<br>00:46:55,519 –&gt; 00:46:59,647<br>You’re just a kid. You don’t have the<br>faintest idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>622<br>00:46:59,773 –&gt; 00:47:03,272</p>
<p>Why, thank you.</p>
<p>It’s all right.</p>
<p>623<br>00:47:03,401 –&gt; 00:47:05,726<br>You’ve never been out of Boston.</p>
<p>624<br>00:47:07,988 –&gt; 00:47:09,612<br>Nope.</p>
<p>625<br>00:47:09,740 –&gt; 00:47:14,733<br>So if I asked you about art, you’d probably give<br>me the skinny on every art book ever written.</p>
<p>626<br>00:47:14,869 –&gt; 00:47:18,736<br>Michelangelo.<br>You know a lot about him.</p>
<p>627<br>00:47:18,872 –&gt; 00:47:22,241<br>Life’s work. Political aspirations.<br>Him and the pope.</p>
<p>628<br>00:47:22,375 –&gt; 00:47:26,835<br>Sexual orientation.<br>The whole works, right?</p>
<p>629<br>00:47:26,962 –&gt; 00:47:31,209<br>I bet you can’t tell me what<br>it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>630<br>00:47:33,426 –&gt; 00:47:37,470<br>You never actually stood there<br>and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.</p>
<p>631<br>00:47:40,265 –&gt; 00:47:42,803<br>Seen that.</p>
<p>632<br>00:47:42,934 –&gt; 00:47:44,808<br>If I ask you about women…</p>
<p>633<br>00:47:44,936 –&gt; 00:47:48,518<br>you’ll probably give me a syllabus<br>of your personal favourites.</p>
<p>634<br>00:47:48,647 –&gt; 00:47:51,138<br>You may have even been laid<br>a few times.</p>
<p>635<br>00:47:56,946 –&gt; 00:48:00,112<br>But you can’t tell me what it feels like<br>to wake up next to a woman…</p>
<p>636<br>00:48:00,241 –&gt; 00:48:02,565<br>and feel truly happy.</p>
<p>637<br>00:48:05,787 –&gt; 00:48:07,660<br>You’re a tough kid.</p>
<p>638<br>00:48:09,457 –&gt; 00:48:13,039<br>I ask you about war, you’d probably, uh,<br>throw Shakespeare at me, right?</p>
<p>639<br>00:48:13,168 –&gt; 00:48:16,453<br>“Once more into the breach,<br>dear friends. “</p>
<p>640<br>00:48:18,131 –&gt; 00:48:21,084<br>But you’ve never been near one.</p>
<p>641<br>00:48:21,217 –&gt; 00:48:23,968<br>You’ve never held<br>your best friend’s head in your lap…</p>
<p>642<br>00:48:24,094 –&gt; 00:48:28,091<br>and watch him gasp his last breath<br>lookin’ to you for help.</p>
<p>643<br>00:48:30,391 –&gt; 00:48:33,842<br>I ask you about love,<br>you’d probably quote me a sonnet…</p>
<p>644<br>00:48:35,479 –&gt; 00:48:39,855<br>but you’ve never looked at a woman<br>and been totally vulnerable.</p>
<p>645<br>00:48:39,982 –&gt; 00:48:44,062<br>Known someone that could<br>level you with her eyes.</p>
<p>646<br>00:48:44,194 –&gt; 00:48:48,690<br>Feelin’ like God put an angel on Earth<br>just for you…</p>
<p>647<br>00:48:48,823 –&gt; 00:48:51,528<br>who could rescue you<br>from the depths of hell.</p>
<p>648<br>00:48:51,659 –&gt; 00:48:54,944<br>And you wouldn’t know<br>what it’s like to be her angel…</p>
<p>649<br>00:48:55,078 –&gt; 00:48:58,114<br>to have that love for her<br>be there forever.</p>
<p>650<br>00:48:58,248 –&gt; 00:49:02,708<br>Through anything. Through cancer.</p>
<p>651<br>00:49:02,835 –&gt; 00:49:06,879<br>And you wouldn’t know about sleepin’ sittin’ up in<br>a hospital room for two months holding her hand…</p>
<p>652<br>00:49:07,005 –&gt; 00:49:08,914<br>because the doctors could see<br>in your eyes…</p>
<p>653<br>00:49:09,049 –&gt; 00:49:12,168<br>that the terms “visiting hours”<br>don’t apply to you.</p>
<p>654<br>00:49:13,969 –&gt; 00:49:16,092<br>You don’t know about real loss…</p>
<p>655<br>00:49:16,221 –&gt; 00:49:19,886<br>‘cause that only occurs when you love<br>something more than you love yourself.</p>
<p>656<br>00:49:21,309 –&gt; 00:49:24,724<br>I doubt you’ve ever dared<br>to love anybody that much.</p>
<p>657<br>00:49:27,648 –&gt; 00:49:32,641<br>I look at you, I don’t see<br>an intelligent, confident man.</p>
<p>658<br>00:49:34,862 –&gt; 00:49:38,231<br>I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.</p>
<p>659<br>00:49:39,950 –&gt; 00:49:43,283<br>But you’re a genius, Will.<br>No one denies that.</p>
<p>660<br>00:49:43,411 –&gt; 00:49:46,993<br>No one could possibly understand<br>the depths of you.</p>
<p>661<br>00:49:47,122 –&gt; 00:49:50,076<br>But you presume to know everything about<br>me because you saw a painting of mine.</p>
<p>662<br>00:49:50,208 –&gt; 00:49:52,877<br>You ripped my fuckin’ life apart.</p>
<p>663<br>00:49:56,881 –&gt; 00:49:58,837<br>You’re an orphan, right?</p>
<p>664<br>00:50:03,261 –&gt; 00:50:06,843<br>Do you think I’d know the first thing<br>about how hard your life has been…</p>
<p>665<br>00:50:06,972 –&gt; 00:50:09,545<br>how you feel, who you are…</p>
<p>666<br>00:50:09,683 –&gt; 00:50:12,968<br>because I read Oliver Twist?</p>
<p>667<br>00:50:13,103 –&gt; 00:50:15,510<br>Does that encapsulate you?</p>
<p>668<br>00:50:17,732 –&gt; 00:50:20,269<br>Personally, I don’t give a shit<br>about all that.</p>
<p>669<br>00:50:20,400 –&gt; 00:50:25,560<br>Because you know what? I can’t learn anything<br>from you I can’t read in some fuckin’ book.</p>
<p>670<br>00:50:27,198 –&gt; 00:50:31,361<br>Unless you want to talk about you,<br>who you are.</p>
<p>671<br>00:50:32,869 –&gt; 00:50:36,913<br>Then I’m fascinated.<br>I’m in.</p>
<p>672<br>00:50:38,874 –&gt; 00:50:41,626<br>But you don’t wanna do that,<br>do you, sport?</p>
<p>673<br>00:50:44,254 –&gt; 00:50:46,127<br>You’re terrified<br>of what you might say.</p>
